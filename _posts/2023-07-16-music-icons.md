For this poster series I wanted to use fabric to emphasize the struggles that each music icon went through. By incorporating imagery of fabrics that each musician would wear, I hope the viewer will feel closer to the musician and sympathize with their struggles.

## Sketching and Initial Ideas

Originally I decided how I was going to organize my page using variations of different ratios, and sketched some general ideas.

{: .image-grid}

When moving to the computer, I made the type my priority, and created a readable hierarchy before implementing any other elements.

## Imagery

When deciding which fabrics to photograph, it was important to keep the personality of the three different people in mind, and pick fabrics they would likely wear.

## Process

Creating my “toolbox” (AKA laying out my options in one document to then refine and pare down from).
