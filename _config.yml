description: "Hello! I am a Communication Design student at the University of Cincinnati. I am a sophomore, and I am extremely passionate about my studies. Right now, I hope to learn more about different aspects of the design field through my future co-op placements. Outside of school, I have two cats that I spend time with, and I love playing the violin."
